#This is due to a combination of lack of awareness, interest, applicability, and capacity: standards work requires sustained, long-term effort and engagement with the community to build trust with key stakeholders and introduce new ideas.

#Standardisation of research outputs is an excellent – and potentially quantifiable – way to achieve meaningful impact from research activities. However, engagement with the standardisation process can be hard and a little mysterious.

The Glasgow Standardisation Community of Practice (GSCOP) brings together researchers and professionals from different areas to share experience and support each other about the translation of research outcomes to standards.

We hold various [in-person events](#dates) and have a [teams page]().

The goal of GSCOP is to increase awareness of standardisation as a possible path to be followed by researchers in the University, with the long-term aim of enhancing the University’s standards-related impact. In short, to create a UoG-wide standardization community of practice.
