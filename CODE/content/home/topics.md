### Why Should I Care About Standards?

The translation of _any_ research works into standards (or the often closely related policy) is a direct way to address EPSRCâ€™s goal of achieving meaningful impact and engagement with society from research, to support technology transfer, and to encourage commercial take-up of research results. 

### How Can GSCOP Help Me?

-	What are standards?
